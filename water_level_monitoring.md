# Water Level Monitioring

## What is the need of Water Level Monitoring!!!!

This project is implemented keeping in mind the increase-in scarcity of water. So, this project will tell the user about the water level in 
tank and thus, it can be prevented from getting overflown.

## Hardware Required

1.) Arduino UNO  
2.) Ultrasonic sensor  
3.) LCD  
4.) Buzzer  
5.) 10k Resistors  
6.) Jumper wires  

## Software Required 

Arduino IDE

## Theory behind using Ultrasonic Sensor

Basic principal of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in environment then they return back to the origin as ECHO after striking on any obstacle. When a short ultrasonic pulse is transmitted from a height to the tank containing water then it's transmitted back from liquild level as ultrasonic pulse experiences change in density(ultrasonic pulse first travel through air and bounce of liquid with higher density than air), then travel time of that pulse from transceiver to liquid and back to transceiver is measured.

**NOTE** * Place ultersonic sensor at certain distance from maximum water level.  
         * Tank diameter should not be too small.  
         
## Future Work

**1.** Knowing the status of the water source( whether water is present at source or not)  
**2.** This  IoT  based  proposed  system  is  used  to  acquire  water  level  details  of  a  water source  in  real  time from any  location,  any device  connected  to Internet.
