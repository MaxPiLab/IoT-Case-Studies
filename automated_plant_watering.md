# Automated Plant Watering System

In This Plant Watering System, Soil Moisture Sensor checks the moisture level in the soil and if moisture level is low then Arduino switches On a water pump to provide water to the plant. Water pump gets automatically off when system finds enough moisture in the soil. This system is very useful in Farms, gardens, home etc.  

 ## Hardware Required 

1. Arduino Uno  
2. Soil Moisture Sensor
3. Transistor BC547 (2)  
4. Connecting wires  
5. Power supply 12v 1A  
6. Relay 12v  
7. Water cooler pump  
8. Soil Moisture Sensor  
9. Resistors (1k, 10k)  
10. Variable Resister (10k, 100k)  
11. Terminal connector  
12. Voltage Regulator IC LM317  

## Software Required

1. Arduino IDE  

## Future Work

Whenever system switched On or off the pump, a message can be sent to the user via **GSM module**, updating the status of water pump and soil moisture. In this way, owner will also be aware of the things happening in his garden or farm etc.!!!!
