# What is Arduino???

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on hardware (single-board microcontroller) and software (arduino software-**I**ntegrated **D**evelopement **E**nvironment aka **IDE**).  

Generally, arduino-boards are Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller based . Arduino-boards have facillity of **analog and digital I/O pins** making it able to interact with the physical world. This is acheived by sending instruction to arduino-boards. This is done with Arduino programming language (typically like C nad C++) and Ardino software (**IDE**).

## why to choose Arduino??

1.) Inexpensive  
2.) Cross-platform  
3.) Simple, clear programming environment  
4.) Open source and extensible software  
5.) Open source and extensible hardware  

There are many Arduino-boards designed for different purposes.  

There are many appliactions you can use with Arduino.
